### Changes:
- The folder structure uses the **App Directory** format with nested routing for sections like components, marketplace, and user profiles.
- **`app/(components)/`, `app/(marketplace)/`, and `app/(profile)/`** are suggested folders to implement modular features within the app structure.
- Added a **`middleware.ts`** file entry for potential authentication and route protection.
